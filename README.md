# Ecourse - Recommender System Based on Customer Cluster
### FTDS-017-HCK-Team-2

## Team Members:
  1. Syihabuddin Ahmad Satisma (Data Analyst & Data Scientist)
  2. Ryan Trisnadi (Data Scientist)
  3. Gracia Valerine (Data Scientist)
  4. Vincent Kaunang (Data Engineering & Data Analyst)

## Problem Statement
We researched sales at an electronics store and found that the sales of electronic goods have been continuously increasing over time.

To improve the performance and quality of the electronics store, we created a machine learning model aimed at providing recommendations for related or similar products based on customers' search history at the store.

In this way, we hope to enhance the customer shopping experience and drive further sales.


## Objective:

1. Goal:
The goal of creating this recommendation model is to provide similar product recommendations to customers.

2. User:
Recommendation Model: Software Engineering Division, PR/Marketing Division
Exploratory Data Analysis: Senior Management Team
   
## Background:
