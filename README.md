# Ecourse - Recommender System Based on Customer Cluster
### FTDS-017-HCK-Team-2

## Team Members:
  1. Syihabuddin Ahmad Satisma (Data Analyst & Data Scientist)
  2. Ryan Trisnadi (Data Scientist)
  3. Gracia Valerine (Data Scientist)
  4. Vincent Kaunang (Data Engineering & Data Analyst)

## Problem Statement

This project is created to implement a recommender system on Ecorse's e-commerce website to recommend similarly purchased products for customers. The project's goal is to analyze various products using the K-means clustering method to differentiate the types of customers the recommender will target. The intended audience of the project would be the Software Engineering Division, PR/Marketing Division, and the Senior Management Team which will be analyzing the various metrics of each cluster to gain insights on increasing overall revenue, promotion, and reputation of Ecorse's website. 

As the Team researched sales figures at the electronics stores and found that the sales of electronic goods have been continuously increasing over time, the Team would like to improve the performance and quality of the electronics store as machine learning models have been created to provide recommendations for related or similar products based on customers' search history at the store.

As such, the Team hopes to enhance the customer shopping experience and drive further sales in the future. 

## Objective:

  -

1. Goal:
The goal of creating this recommendation model is to provide similar product recommendations to customers based on various metrics such as product category or order date.

2. User:
Recommendation Model: Software Engineering Division, PR/Marketing Division
Exploratory Data Analysis: Senior Management Team
   
## Background: 

The background for undertaking this project is the consistently increasing sales of electronic goods over time. To enhance the performance and quality of our electronics store, we are developing a machine learning model aimed at providing recommendations for related or similar products based on customers' search history in our store. By doing so, we hope to improve the shopping experience for our customers and drive further sales.
