# Final-Project

## Objective:

The purpose of developing a model to recommend electronic tools is to enhance the shopping experience for customers by providing more relevant and personalized product suggestions. This model aims to analyze historical purchase data, customer preferences, and consumer behavior patterns to identify products that best meet the needs and interests of each individual. By offering more targeted recommendations, it is expected to increase customer satisfaction, reduce the time needed to find desired products, and boost sales and customer loyalty. Additionally, this model can help retailers manage inventory more efficiently by better understanding product demand trends. 

## Background: 

The background for undertaking this project is the consistently increasing sales of electronic goods over time. To enhance the performance and quality of our electronics store, we are developing a machine learning model aimed at providing recommendations for related or similar products based on customers' search history in our store. By doing so, we hope to improve the shopping experience for our customers and drive further sales.
