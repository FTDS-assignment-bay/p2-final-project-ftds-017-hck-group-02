## Problem Statement
...

## Objective:

1. Develop an automated segmentation model to categorize customers more accurately and efficiently based on their behavior and preferences.
2. Develop an automated recommender system to provide personalized product suggestions and enhance the shopping experience.
   
## Background: 

The background for undertaking this project is the consistently increasing sales of electronic goods over time. To enhance the performance and quality of our electronics store, we are developing a machine learning model aimed at providing recommendations for related or similar products based on customers' search history in our store. By doing so, we hope to improve the shopping experience for our customers and drive further sales.

### Dataset:
The dataset that we use is from kaggle and can be found through this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naofilahmad/sales-datset-product-sample).
